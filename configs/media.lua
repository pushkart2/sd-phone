-- LIVE VIDEO RELAY. You almost certainly do not need this. Leave Enabled = false and everything
-- works: Photogram Live and Vibez Live both stream fine without it.
--
-- What it is for: those live broadcasts normally send their video through the game server. That is
-- fine for a few viewers. If you run big broadcasts and want the video to travel between players'
-- browsers instead of through the game, this sends it down a separate connection.
--
-- Turning it on needs a domain name with a working SSL certificate (https). There is no way around
-- that: the phone's screen is a web page, and browsers refuse insecure video connections. If you do
-- not have one, leave this off.
--
-- This is NOT the setting for video calls or voice. That is TURN, in configs/voice.lua.
-- This is NOT where photo uploads go. That is Provider in configs/photos.lua.
--
-- If you do turn it on, put these two lines in your server.cfg (never in this file, so a key cannot
-- end up in a git commit):
--     set sd_phone_relay_url "wss://media.example.com/ws"
--     set sd_phone_relay_key "paste-64-random-characters-here"
-- Generate the key with `openssl rand -hex 32`. The relay program in media-server/ needs the same
-- key as its SD_PHONE_RELAY_KEY environment variable. It is only used for this: it unlocks nothing
-- else on your server.
