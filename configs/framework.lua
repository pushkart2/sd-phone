-- ox_core, not yet wired: employee and owner NAMES come back blank in the Services roster and
-- Homes offline lookups. Identity, cash and
-- bank money, jobs, gangs and society balances are all wired.
--
-- Only ox_core needs anything here: QBCore, QBox, ESX and ND all name
-- their concepts the same way on every install, so the bridge reads them without asking.
--
-- ND in particular needs NOTHING configured. Its `nd_groups` table carries an `isJob` flag per
-- group, so the phone reads which groups are jobs and which are gangs straight from ND, and
-- `nd_group_ranks.isBoss` gives it a real boss grade rather than the guess ox_core needs below.
-- Not wired on ND, because ND_Core has no such concept: company balances (the Services app keeps
-- its roster, hiring and boss actions, but shows no shared account), on-duty state, and jail.
--
-- ox_core has no jobs or gangs. It has GROUPS, and a group's `type` is a free-form string the
-- server owner picks when creating it (types/index.ts declares it `type?: string`, with no
-- enforced vocabulary and no default). So the phone cannot guess which of your groups are jobs
-- and which are gangs the way it can on the other three - you tell it here.
