-- lb-phone -> sd-phone data migration. When a server switches from lb-phone to sd-phone this
-- carries each player's essentials across, so people keep their phone instead of starting over:
-- phone number + lock passcode, contacts, call history, blocked numbers, SMS threads (incl.
-- groups), photos + albums, and notes.
--
-- Nothing happens until you ask for it. /phoneadmin -> Migration previews what is on the other
-- side, takes a domain selection and streams the run; set `enabled` below if you would rather it
-- ran by itself on the next boot instead.
--
-- It is idempotent and non-destructive. A marker row (phone_migrations) stops it running twice,
-- every write is INSERT IGNORE / fill-only, and a player who already has sd-phone data is never
-- overwritten. Safe to leave enabled forever: once there is nothing left to import it is a cheap
-- no-op. The join is lb-phone's phone owner id -> framework citizenid, and each player's lb-phone
-- number is adopted as their sd-phone number so every contact / thread / call log still lines up.
--
-- With unique phones on (configs/uniqueandsim.lua), the join is per PHONE instead: lb-phone keys
-- its data by phone number, so a player holding two phones has two separate sets of contacts and
-- photos, and both come across intact. Their phone items need no editing - sd-phone reads the
-- number lb-phone already wrote onto them. Servers without unique phones are unaffected: each
-- player keeps one number, exactly as before.

    -- the import; both commands work while automatic startup migration is disabled.
