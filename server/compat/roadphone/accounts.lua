-- RoadID is a phone-wide cloud account a player signs into and carries between devices. sd-phone
-- has no such account: each app signs in on its own through the accounts engine, and the only
-- phone-wide "cloud" is a per-device backup snapshot with no session behind it. A resource wanting
-- the account behind a player should ask per app instead - exports['sd-phone']:getSessionAccount(app,
--- citizenid) answers for mail, birdy, photogram, cherry and vibez.
---@type string The clause the RoadID family shares.

-- The legacy account-metadata family is the pre-session RoadID blob RoadPhone's own docs say not to
