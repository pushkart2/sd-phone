---server has ever hosted, for every app, so a presigned-upload claim can be told apart from a URL
---that already belongs to something else.
---
---It exists because of a real bug. The claim's uniqueness check originally asked phone_photos,
---which is one of more than forty tables holding URLs in the same bucket. A bodycam recording -
---same bucket, video/webm, absent from phone_photos - passed every other check and could be
---claimed into any player's gallery as a trusted row, laundering it out of its original access
---control. Asking "does Photos know this URL" was never the question; "have we ever hosted it"
---is.

local TABLE <const> = 'phone_media_urls'

---@type string Marker row proving the one-time backfill finished. A row rather than the table's
---existence, so a backfill that dies part way through is retried on the next boot instead of
---being mistaken for a complete one.
local MARKER <const> = 'sdphone-ledger-backfill-complete'

---@type string The CDN every direct upload lands in. Shared with server.photos.presign, which
---pins claims to this host, so the two can never drift apart.

---claim checked against a half-filled ledger would accept URLs it is meant to refuse, so the

---remembering to come back here. Columns that hold no URLs simply match nothing.

---Text and JSON columns are deliberately not scanned. Media inside them - a social post's images,
---a message's attachments - was shared out of a player's own gallery and is therefore already in
