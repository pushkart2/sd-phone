---@class FrameworkInfo
---@field name 'qbx'|'qb'|'esx'|'ox'|'nd' Detected framework identifier.
---@field qb boolean True for both QBox and QBCore, whose player objects share a shape. False on
---ox_core and ND, which share nothing with them - never use it as a stand-in for "not ESX".
---@field core any Live core object (QBCore's, or the ESX shared object). Nil on QBox, ox_core and
---ND, none of which has one: everything they need is a discrete export.

---Detects the running player framework and returns a populated FrameworkInfo, or nil when no
---supported framework is started. ND is checked first: it ships esx and qb compatibility shims,
---and while the `provide` lines that would alias them are commented out upstream (they "could
---interfere with resources checking if the resources are started"), checking ND first keeps this
---correct if that ever changes. QBox is checked before qb-core so it is driven through its own
---exports rather than through the qb-core compatibility layer it provides. ox_core is checked
---before qb-core for the same reason, though it ships no compatibility layer to be caught by.
